Hi Louise and Kirsty,

Just a quick note ahead of the witness details research sessions. Wanted to recap what we discussed before Christmas about how we want to run these.

**Research approach**

For these sessions, we want to give participants space to work through things on their own as much as possible. Seeing where they hesitate or get stuck is the valuable bit — it'll show us where the design needs work.

**Context gathering (at the start)**

Before the tasks, it'd be useful to ask a few questions to understand their real-world experience, for example:
- What's the maximum number of witnesses you've had to mark as required to attend court?
- What's the maximum number you've had to mark as not required?
- What's the maximum number of statements you've had to mark as Section 9 for a single witness?

This will help us judge the usability based on the reality of what they actually do day to day.

**Running the scenarios**

Give them everything upfront before they sign in — the URL, case and what we'd like them to do — then let them go.

**Scenario 1**
- Sign in as: Rachael
- Case URN: 99RH250001/1
- Task: Mark the first 10 witnesses as required to attend court

**Scenario 2**
- Sign in as: Simon Whatley
- Case URN: 99SW100001/1
- Task: Mark Aaron Abbott's 10 statements as Section 9

Thanks,
Adam
