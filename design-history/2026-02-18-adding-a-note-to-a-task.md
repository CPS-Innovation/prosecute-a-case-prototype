Users can add notes to tasks to record relevant information or actions taken. 

## How it works

Clicking "Add note" on the [task details page](2026-02-18-adding-a-task-details-page.md) takes the user to  enter a note. 

An inset shows the task name so users can confirm they are acting on the right task.

The user checks their note before confirming. The note has a change link to go back and edit it.

After confirming, the user is taken back to the task details page. A success banner confirms "Note added". The new note appears at the top of the notes list.

### Activity log

The action is recorded in the activity log as "Task note added", showing the task name and the note text.
