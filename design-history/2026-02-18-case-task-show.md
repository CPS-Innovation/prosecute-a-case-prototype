title: Designing the task details page
date: 2026-02-18

Users need to see the full details of a task and take action on it. The task details page brings together all the information about a task in one place and gives users the actions they need.

Users reach the task details page by clicking a task name in the [case task list](2026-02-18-case-task-list.md) or the [task list](2026-02-18-task-list.md).

## How it works

The page heading shows the task name and an Urgent tag where applicable.

Three actions are available:

- **Complete task** - starts the flow to complete the task
- **Defer** - defers the task
- **Mark as urgent / Mark as not urgent** - toggles the urgency status

The summary list shows:

- description (for reminders only, with a Change link)
- defendant
- due date (with days remaining or overdue status)
- custody time limit (where applicable)
- statutory time limit (where applicable)
- PACE clock (where applicable)
- urgent reason (where applicable)
- owner (with a Change link)
- unit
- reminder type (for reminders only)

Where a case has a hearing, a separate Hearing section shows the date and time, type, and venue.

The Notes section shows all notes added to the task, each with the note text, the user who added it, and the date it was added. Users can add a new note using the "Add note" button.
