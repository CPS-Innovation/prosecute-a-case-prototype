title: Adding a direction details page

Previously, direction details were shown in an expanding row within the direction list. 

This squeezed a lot of information into a single page, making it harder to read and act on. 

A separate page gives each direction the space it needs and is simpler to navigate.

## How it works

Clicking a direction in the [case direction list](2026-02-17-allowing-users-to-see-directions-for-a-specific-case.md) or the [direction list](2026-02-16-redesigning-the-direction-list.md) takes the user to the details page.

The page heading shows the direction description and a status tag where applicable.

Two actions are available:

- **Complete direction** - starts the flow to complete the direction
- **Delete** - deletes the direction

The summary list shows:

- title
- description (with a change link)
- defendant (where applicable)
- assignee
- due date (with a change link)
- custody time limit (where applicable)
- unit

Where a case has a hearing, a separate hearing section shows the details of the hearing.

The notes section shows all notes added to the direction.

Users can add a new note using the "Add note" button.
