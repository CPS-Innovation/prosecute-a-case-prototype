Tasks that have been marked as urgent can be marked as not urgent. 

## How it works

Clicking "Mark as not urgent" on the [task details page](2026-02-17-adding-a-task-details-page.md) takes the user to a page to enter a reason for marking the task as not urgent. 

An inset shows the task name so users can confirm they are acting on the right task.

After entering a reason, the user is taken to the check answers page:

The reason has a change link to go back and change it.

After clicking "Mark as not urgent", the user is taken back to the task details page. A success banner confirms "Task marked as not urgent". The Urgent tag is removed from the task heading and the "Mark as not urgent" button is replaced with "Mark as urgent".
