Tasks can be marked as urgent when they need immediate attention.

## How it works

Clicking “Mark as urgent” on the [task details page](2026-02-17-adding-a-task-details-page.md) takes the user to a page to enter a reason for marking the task as urgent.

An inset shows the task name so users can confirm they are acting on the right task.

After entering a reason, the user is taken to the check answers page:

The reason has a change link to go back and edit it.

After clicking “Mark as urgent”, the user is taken back to the task details page. A success banner confirms “Task marked as urgent”. The task heading now shows an Urgent tag, and the urgent reason appears in the task details.
