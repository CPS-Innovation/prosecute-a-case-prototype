title: Allowing users to see tasks for a specific case

The [task list](2026-02-15-redesigning-the-task-list.md) shows all tasks across all cases. The case task list shows all the tasks for a single case in one place.

Users reach the case task list by navigating to a case and clicking "Tasks" in the case navigation.

## How it works

The page shows all open tasks for the case, sorted by due date. There is no filtering - users can see everything at a glance.

Each task card shows:

- task name (as a link)
- urgent tag (where applicable)
- due date (with status - critically overdue, overdue, or days remaining)
- statutory time limit (where applicable)
- custody time limit (where applicable)
- PACE clock (where applicable)
- reason for marking as urgent (where applicable)
- owner
- reminder type (where applicable)
- latest note (where applicable)
- hearing date and type (where applicable)

We only show fields that have values, so cards do not show empty rows.
