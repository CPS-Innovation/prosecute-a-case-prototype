title: Designing the direction details page
date: 2026-02-18

Users need to see the full details of a direction and take action on it. The direction details page brings together all the information about a direction in one place and gives users the actions they need.

Users reach the direction details page by clicking a direction in the [case direction list](2026-02-18-case-direction-list.md) or the [direction list](2026-02-18-directions.md).

## How it works

The page heading shows the direction description and a status tag where applicable.

Two actions are available:

- **Complete direction** - starts the flow to complete the direction
- **Delete** - deletes the direction

The summary list shows:

- title
- description (with a Change link)
- defendant (where applicable)
- assignee
- due date (with a Change link)
- custody time limit (where applicable)
- unit

Where a case has a hearing, a separate Hearing section shows the date and time, type, and venue.

The Notes section shows all notes added to the direction, each with the note text, the user who added it, and the date it was added. Users can add a new note using the "Add note" button.
