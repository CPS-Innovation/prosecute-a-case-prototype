title: Designing the complete direction flow
date: 2026-02-18

Users need to mark directions as complete when the work is done. The complete direction flow gives users a way to confirm they want to complete a direction before doing so.

Users reach the flow by clicking "Complete direction" on the [direction details page](2026-02-18-case-direction-show.md).

## How it works

The confirmation page shows the direction description in an inset and asks users to confirm they want to complete it. A Cancel link lets users go back to the direction details page without making any changes.

After confirming, the user is taken back to the [case direction list](2026-02-18-case-direction-list.md) where a success banner confirms "Direction completed". The completed direction no longer appears in the list.
